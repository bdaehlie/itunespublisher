<html><head><meta name="AppleTitle" content="iTunes Publisher Help - Basics"></head><body><p><b><u>iTunes Publisher Basics</u></b></p><p><b>Getting Started</b></p><p> You will need at least iTunes 3 and Mac OS X 10.2 in order to use iTunes  Publisher. iTunes <i>does not</i> have to be running.</p><p><b>Using iTunes Publisher</b></p><p>Select the type of export you want from the tabs in the main window. Set up  the options the way you want, and hit the &quot;Export...&quot; button in the  top right of the main window. You might have to set up export fields before  saving, depending on the type of export you chose. If you add or modify a playlist  in iTunes while iTunes Publisher is running, you can use the "Refresh" menu  item under "File" to reflect that change in iTunes Publisher.</p><p><strong>Setting Up Export Fields</strong></p><p>Move fields from the left column to the right columns by selecting a field  and hitting the arrow that points to the right. Select a field in one of the  two columns to the right and hit the left arrow to deselect a field. If you  would like to sort in a different order than your field order, you may rearrange  the columns "Field Order" and "Sort Order" by dragging fields up or down. Hit  the "Save" button, and save the document(s). </p><p><b>Encodings</b></p><p>By default, all exported files use UTF-8 text encoding. You may change this  for delimited text exports if you wish. If certain characters do not appear  correctly for you in text editors, you may have to explicity tell your text  editor what your text encoding is. For example - when you choose the exported  file in TextEdit's Open dialog box, you can choose the way in which the file  should be read.</p></body></html>
