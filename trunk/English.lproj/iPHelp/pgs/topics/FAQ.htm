You will no longer have the option to arrange sort order yourself  until you uncheck that box. Sometimes the order is erroneously reversed. See  the explanation below.</p><p><i>My exports with iTunes Ordering come out backwards!</i></p><p>This is entirely out of the control of iTunes Publisher. This happens more  often with Smart Playlists, and occurs because iTunes does not always write  songs to the data file in the same fashion. The solution is to restart iTunes,  then either restart iTunes Publisher or refresh the playlists in iTunes Publisher  (under the file menu, Apple-R).</p><p><i>iTunes Publisher doesn't show all of my playlists, or it shows incorrect/old    ones!</i></p><p>You probably have two iTunes data folders on your computer. iTunes Publisher  is probably using the wrong one. Your old one is probably located at &quot;~/Documents/iTunes&quot; or &quot;~/Music/iTunes&quot;,  where &quot;~&quot; is your home directory. Either delete the old one or move  it out of one of those two locations. Make sure you're not deleting the one  you want! To do a search for your iTunes folders, search for the file "iTunes  Music Library.xml" and you will probably find two or more, each of them in  a different iTunes data folder.</p></body></html>
