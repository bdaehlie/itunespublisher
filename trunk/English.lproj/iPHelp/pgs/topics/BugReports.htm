<p><b><u>Send Bug Reports!</u></b></p>
<p>Send any bug reports to "josha@mac.com". You should find me quite responsive.
Make sure you have read the "Read Me First" document included with iTunes Publisher before you submit bug reports.
I need to know exactly how to reproduce the problem. Give me as many details as possible.</p>
