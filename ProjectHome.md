iTunes Publisher 4 exports playlists from iTunes into the following formats:

  * **HTML -** Export your playlists to web pages that can go straight to your website. Share playlists with your friends, and even automatically link to your MP3 files (don't steal music!). You can export to multiple pages for large playlists, and links between the pages are automatically generated. Exports can be either song-based or album-based.
  * **Tabbed Text -** Import your playlist into databases or spreadsheets.
  * **Quicktime Streaming Server -** Create QTSS playlists easily so you can avoid the annoying interface provided by Apple.
  * **M3U -** A general playlist format. Works with WinAmp and some other audio applications.

Originally developed by Josh Aas. This application is no longer actively maintained.

"There are tons of reasons to print out your Playlists, but iTunes' Export Song List creates a list that's too detailed and confusing for normal use. iTunes Publisher lets you specify which of iTunes' copious information fields to include. Use it to export any Playlist - even your whole Library - to plain text, HTML, or even a Quicktime Streaming Server Playlist."
